About Me
------
Hi, this is Yangfu! I'm a third-year Ph.D student in the School of Computer Science at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), advised by [<a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=qCf-504AAAAJ'>Dr. Bin Wu</a>]. Before joining cSchool, I got my Master's degree in Computer Technology  at Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications (CQUPT). My current research is at the intersection of Human-Centered Natural Language Processing, Affective computing (e.g., Personality computing), and Social network analysis (e.g., Information diffusion). 

Iâ€™m actively looking for applied scientist, machine learning engineer, and research-related positions! Please contact me if you know any opportunitiesðŸ˜€.
