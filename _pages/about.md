About Me
------
Hi, this is Yangfu! I'm a third-year Ph.D. student in the School of Computer Science at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), advised by [<a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=qCf-504AAAAJ'>Prof. Bin Wu</a>]. Before joining cSchool, I got my Master's degree in Computer Technology  at Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications (CQUPT), advised by [<a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zQ-C7wwAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN'>Prof. Yunpeng Xiao</a>]. My research interests lie in large-scale data mining and machine learning on various types of data (e.g., graph, text, and video), with a focus on developing AI/ML solutions for real-world problems.

*Graph mining and learning: Hypergraph Learning, Graph Engine, Influence Maximization
*Human-Centered Natural Language Processing: Large-batch Optimization, Distributed Data Parallelism, Quantization
*AI/ML solutions for real-world problems: Political Polarization, Fake News Detection, Recommender Systems


Iâ€™m actively looking for  research-related positions! Please contact me if you know any opportunitiesðŸ˜€.

%My  research lies at the intersection of  Human-Centered Natural Language Processing, Affective computing (e.g., Personality computing), and Social network analysis (e.g., Information diffusion).
