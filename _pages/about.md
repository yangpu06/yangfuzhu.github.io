About Me
------
Hi, this is Yangfu Zhu! I'm a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the School of Computer Science at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), advised by [<a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=qCf-504AAAAJ'>Prof. Bin Wu</a>]. Before joining cSchool, I got my Master's degree in Computer Technology  at Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications (CQUPT), advised by [<a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zQ-C7wwAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN'>Prof. Yunpeng Xiao</a>]. My research interests lie in large-scale data mining and machine learning on various types of data (e.g., graph, text, and video), with a focus on developing AI/ML solutions for real-world problems.  This is my Chinese resume  [<a href='/files/zyf_cv.pdf' >中文简历</a>].  <br>
- **Graph Mining and Learning:** (Graph neural network, Knowledge graph )
- **Human-Centered Natural Language Processing:** (User-generated document analysis, Social bias analysis )   
- **AI/ML Solutions for Real-world Problems:** (Personality computing, Cultural computing, Fake news detection )
<br>     
I’m actively looking for research-related positions! Please contact me if you know any opportunities😀.
